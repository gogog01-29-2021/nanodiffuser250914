"""
Utilities for applying weight-only INT8 quantization to nano diffusion models.

This module provides placeholder functions for converting model weights to 8-bit
precision. To use actual quantization backends such as `bitsandbytes` or
`torchao`, integrate those libraries here and wrap supported layers accordingly.

def quantize_int8(model: Any) -> Any:
    """
    Apply weight-only INT8 quantization to a model.

    This function returns the same model instance with quantization applied. In a
    real implementation, you would convert supported layers (e.g., linear and
    convolutional layers) to 8-bit precision using a quantization library. The
    returned model should behave identically to the original model except for
    using reduced precision weights.

        model: A PyTorch `nn.Module` (or similar) to quantize.
